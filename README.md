### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am NetheriteMiner, currently a student majoring in Computer Science very soon!
- Pronouns: He/Him and They/Them. You can use just one pronoun set if you prefer but I appreciate variety.
- Recently, I've enjoyed worked on SkyHanni, a Minecraft modification for Hypixel Skyblock. I'm very proud of my contributions there.
- Furthermore, I really like connecting APIs together to do interesting things with them. My biggest project related to this would be my Discord bot, Ultimate Nerd. Ultimate Nerd has a command to play music and the queue gets sent to the GitHub Pages website hosted right here, on this repository!
