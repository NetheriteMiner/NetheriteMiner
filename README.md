### Hi there 👋

- I am NetheriteMiner, currently a student majoring in Computer Science!
- Pronouns: He/Him and They/Them. You can use just one pronoun set if you prefer but I appreciate variety.
- Previously, I've enjoyed worked on SkyHanni, a Minecraft modification for Hypixel Skyblock.
- Now, I am currently working on spigot/paper plugin development to make a Minecraft server plugin for my friends and I.
- Furthermore, I really like connecting APIs together to do interesting things with them. My biggest project related to this would be my Discord bot, Ultimate Nerd. Ultimate Nerd has a command to play music and the queue gets sent to a website that was formerly hosted on Replit. Unfortunately, this is no longer possible but the code still exists! I now host and maintain it on my own private linux server.
- I am also dabbling in making a game with Microsoft's MakeCode Arcade
- My computer runs a dual boot setup of mainly Linux Mint but I have Windows for when wine (the program) doesn't cut it
- And finally, I am currently learning
    - C
    - Java fundamentals I should have learned a long time ago but never did
    - And a little bit of TypeScript
