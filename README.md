I am NetheriteMiner, currently a student majoring in Computer Science very soon!
Pronouns: He/Him and They/Them. You can use just one pronoun set if you prefer but I appreciate variety.
Recently, I've enjoyed worked on SkyHanni, a Minecraft modification for Hypixel Skyblock. I'm very proud of my contributions there.
