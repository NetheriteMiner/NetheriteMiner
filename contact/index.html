	<p>My main preferred method of contact is through <a href="https://www.discord.com">discord</a>, all you need is to be in 1 or more mutual servers with me (official Minecraft, Hypixel, Discord Developers... you'll have something) and my dms are always open in every server. I just don't accept friend requests if you don't know me in real life. @netheriteminer. <br><br>Sorry if you are unable to reach me :/</p>
