	<p>I use Replit for pretty much all of my online projects, including this website.<br><br><ul>
		<li>Ultimate Nerd</li>
		A Discord Bot that was especially designed for my friend's server. Uses slash commands. Filled with spaghetti code, but if you want to know more about it, it's <a href="https://replit.com/@NetheriteMiner/Ultimate-Nerd">here</a>. There's an associated website viewer that shows data from the bot at <a href="https://netheriteminer.tk/projects/ultimate-nerd">here</a><br><br>
		<li>Unnamed Platformer</li>
		My first time using Pygame! I am currently in the process of making a fully playable executable game. Once it's done, you will be able to download it on this website. (Making this website was just an excuse to have some online place to put the assets)<br><br>
		<li>If you have any ideas then I will gladly take them if you direct message me on Discord!</li>
